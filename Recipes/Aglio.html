    <h1>Aglio E Olio</h1>

        <p>Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” 
        The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. 
        It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of 
        red pepper flakes, but even these are optional. In its simplest form, 
        this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.

    <h3>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio Recipe Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spaghetti:</b> If you don't have spaghetti on hand, use whatever pasta you do have. I recommend choosing a long pasta like fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, but if short-cut pasta is what's in your kitchen, it'll still come out delicious.</li>
        <li><b>Olive oil:</b> Use the best one you have.</li>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> The star ingredient! Don't skimp on it's essential for infusing the pasta with rich, nutty flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Red pepper flakes: </b> For heat! If you're sensitive to spice, feel free to skip them, or start with just 1/4 teaspoon. If you want your pasta to have more of a kick, add up to 1/2 teaspoon.</li>
        <li><b>Parsley: </b> Sprinkle it over the pasta for a lovely fresh finish.</li>
        <li><b>Lemon:</b> It may not be totally authentic, but if you ask me, a little lemon never hurt anything. I use both lemon juice and zest to fill this pasta with bright flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Kale:</b> If you ask me, pasta + greens are a match made in heaven. Feel free to skip the kale if you prefer, or use different greens, such as spinach or Swiss chard, if you don't have any kale on hand.</li>
        <li><b>Parmesan cheese: </b> Aglio e olio purists will tell you never to serve it with cheese, but I think a shower of freshly grated Parmesan or vegan Parmesan is a welcome touch. Its nutty taste pairs perfectly with the savory garlic.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How to Make Spaghetti Aglio e Olio: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>First, cook the pasta. </b>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you drain it!</li>
        <li><b>Next, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. </b>Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.</li>
        <li><b>Then, add the kale.</b>Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts.</li>
        <li><b>Finally, stir in the pasta,</b>along with the lemon juice and zest and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as needed, to create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That’s it!</li>
        <li><b>Garnish</b> the pasta aglio e olio with parsley and Parmesan cheese.</li>
