    <h1>Easy, Creamy Lemon Garlic Skillet Chicken Recipe</h1>
    
    <img src="https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_center,w_730,h_913/at%2Farchive%2F6c6cebd013fd68fe8699157859b61918353479d4">
        <p>
            This rich and creamy skillet dinner is just the kind of thing I want to eat on cold winter nights. The chicken breasts simmer in a pan of lemon garlic goodness, 
            and taste like they were made at your favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant. Because the recipe comes together so quickly — 
            less than 30 minutes — you can turn to it over and over again, no matter how busy life gets.

            This recipe basically makes itself, leaving you time to pull together an easy side. Since there's lots of sauce that deserves to be soaked up, we love serving the chicken 
            over rice, orzo, or mashed potatoes, or with a side of crusty bread. A simple leafy greens salad or steamed green beans are also nice additions to round out the meal.

        <h3> Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds total), pounded to 1/2-inch thickness </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
            <li>1 small shallot, finely chopped </li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half or whole milk </li>
            <li>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth </li>
            <li>Juice of 1 medium lemon (about 3 tablespoons) </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves </li>
            <li>1 small lemon, thinly sliced
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Instructions:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Thoroughly dry the chicken with paper towels. Generously season all over with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a 10-inch or larger skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches if needed, 
                add the chicken and sear until deeply browned on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip with tongs and sear the other 
                side until browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate; set aside.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter. When melted, add the shallot, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
                and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until just starting to soften, about 1 minute. 
                Add the flour, stir to evenly coat the shallots and garlic, and cook for 1 minute more.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>   
                Stir in the half-and-half or milk and broth until no lumps from the flour remain, making sure to scrape up any
                browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Return the chicken to the
                pan and simmer until the sauce is thickened enough that it coats the back of a spoon and the chicken is cooked 
                through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir the lemon juice into the sauce. Garnish with the parsley and lemon slices and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
