            I love to sear salmon in a skillet because it yields a perfectly crisp seared exterior while the interior stays nice and tender. 
            When you think there's just no time for dinner, there's always time to sear a salmon fillet and add a bright squeeze of lemon juice.

            But here we've got 5 extra minutes so I made this seriously delicious garlic butter lemon sauce. That saying the “the secret's in the sauce” holds true on this one.
            The lemon butter sauce for salmon is made up of 4 basic ingredients (garlic, butter, fresh lemon juice and chicken broth) and once you try it you'll want to add it to everything.

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>   

    <ul>
        <li><b>Salmon fillets - </b>main ingredient. Rich in omega 3 and great source of protein!</li>
        <li><b>Salt and pepper - </b>so the salmon isn't bland.</li>
        <li><b>Olive oil - </b>to help brown the salmon and prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><b>Chicken broth - </b>to create a sauce. White wine will work great too.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh lemon - </b>for bright flavor. It's the perfect complement to salmon.</li>
        <li><b>Garlic - </b> for another layer of flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Garlic - </b> for richness.</li>
        <li><b>Honey - </b>to balance out the tartness of the lemon.</li>
        <li><b>Parsley - </b>for a nice colorful garnish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    
    <ol> 
        <li>Let salmon rest at room temperature briefly, so it cooks evenly.</li>
        <li>Make the lemon butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt 1 tsp butter over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Let sauce simmer until it has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter and honey, set sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Dab both sides of salmon dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add salmon and cook until done to your liking.</li>
        <li>Plate salmon and drizzle each serving generously with lemon butter sauce, sprinkle with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
